## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up your environment and run the `main.py` application.

## Prerequisites

- Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed on your system.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Create a Virtual Environment**

   Create a virtual environment to manage dependencies separately from your system Python installation:

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   ```

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment**

   Activate the virtual environment. Use the appropriate command for your operating system:

   - On macOS and Linux:
     ```bash
     source .venv/bin/activate
     ```
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     .venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

3. **Install Required Libraries**

   With the virtual environment activated, install the required libraries specified in `requirements.txt`:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Application**

   Finally, run the `main.py` application:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Additional Notes

- Make sure that you are in the correct directory where `main.py` is located before running the application.
- If you encounter any issues, make sure your virtual environment is activated and all dependencies are installed correctly.
